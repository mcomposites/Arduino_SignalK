# Arduino-SignalK Integration

## Description
This Arduino project is designed to integrate with a SignalK network, primarily for marine or caravan applications. It includes functionalities for Wi-Fi connectivity, communication with a SignalK server, and control of various systems (like lighting). The project features a 128x64 pixel I2C display for real-time status updates and system checks.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino compatible board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or ESP8266 module)
- 128x64 pixel I2C OLED display
- Necessary cables and connectors for the Arduino board and peripherals

## Software Dependencies
- Arduino IDE for coding and uploading the sketch to the Arduino board
- Adafruit_SSD1306 library for the I2C display
- Adafruit_GFX library for graphics functions
- Additional libraries for Wi-Fi and SignalK communication

## Setup and Configuration
1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Install the required libraries (Adafruit_SSD1306, Adafruit_GFX, and others) through the Arduino IDE's Library Manager.
3. Connect the I2C display to your Arduino board according to the displayâ€™s pin configuration.
4. Configure your Arduino board with the provided sketch (`Stiletto_giga_modified.ino`).
5. Update the Wi-Fi credentials and SignalK server details in the sketch to match your setup.

## Usage
- Power on the Arduino system.
- The I2C display will show the status of system checks during startup, including Wi-Fi and SignalK server connectivity.
- The system will control and monitor connected peripherals based on the sketch's functionalities.

## Notes
- This project is a starting point and can be expanded to include additional features and functionalities.
- Ensure to follow proper electronic safety protocols while setting up the hardware.
